# Introduction
Repository containing code to deploy the Remote Forecaster: a mobile app what show you why you should go to the office today!

# Motivation
In a world beyond the verge of the change, where more and more people are starting working from all around, we need
to be aware of the impact of such a choice. Not only on our social sphere, but also on 
the environment and our own health. Why do we need to know that? Because only through conscious decisions
one can shape their behaviour and change their lives, their society and, ultimately, the environment. For the better.

Remote Forecaster helps you to understand the impact of going to the office or not, depending on your habits, 
meteorological situation and office air quality conditions. Improve your decisions, by be aware of what they are producing.
